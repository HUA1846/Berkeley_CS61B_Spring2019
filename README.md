|Challenge Labs|         |Description |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| clab 6    |[BubbleGrid](https://github.com/HUA1846/CS61B_Self_Study/tree/main/clab6%20-BubbleGrid)|Use Union Find DS to solve bubble grid problem
| clab 7    |[BST Performance](https://github.com/HUA1846/CS61B_Self_Study/tree/main/clab7)|Experiment BST average depth with random insertion and symmetric/asymmetric deletions 
| clab 8    |[FlightSolver, RabinKarp](https://github.com/HUA1846/Berkeley_CS61B_Spring2019/tree/main/clab8)|Part 1: Use HashMap and PQ to solve max passengers problem
|           ||Part 2: implement RabinKarp string-searching algorithm that “uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text”. Hash performance is constant time. One practical application is detecting plagiarism.
| clab 9    |[Graph, SeparableEnemy](https://github.com/HUA1846/Berkeley_CS61B_Spring2019/tree/main/clab9)|Use graph to separate the party-goers into two groups such that no two members of the same group are enemies.
| clab 11   |[Bears and Beds](https://github.com/HUA1846/Berkeley_CS61B_Spring2019/tree/main/clab11)|Modify quick sort method to sort a list of bears and a list of beds, so that the sizes of bears and beds match.
