2. Hibbard deletion    
    Randomly delete an item using asymmetric Hibbard deletion.
    Randomly insert a new item.
    Record the average depth of the tree.
    Repeat M operations

3. symmetric deletion
    Randomly delete an item using symmetric deletion (i.e. randomly picking between successor and predecessor)
    Randomly insert a new item.
    Record the average depth of the tree.
    Repeat M operations
